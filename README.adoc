== Getting started (IntelliJ)

* Import into IntelliJ, using `File > New > Module from Existing Sources`

* in the `kitchensinkapp-webapp`, locate `ide/intellij/launch` directory

* as per the README says, copy files into `workspace\.idea\runConfigurations` directory, and adjust file paths for Maven tasks.


== Running the app

The `-with-fixtures` run configuration runs the app using an additional system property that instructs Isis 
to run the fixture script defined in `WEB-INF/isis.properties`.

Login using `sven/pass`.


== Eager Loading Demo (ISIS-1232)

The script below was used in link:https://youtu.be/hSKnqqBQ7Zo[this screencast] to show how the `x-ro-follow-links`
query argument can be used to support uses cases such as table grids (avoiding the "N+1" problem).

* parent object: +
+
pass:[<pre>http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/PARENT/0]

* children of parent: +
+
pass:[<pre>http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/PARENT/0/collections/children]

* expand the children (follow each of their links): +
+
pass:[<pre>http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/PARENT/0/collections/children?x-ro-follow-links=value.href]

* show parent and its children (titles) +
+
pass:[<pre>http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/PARENT/0?x-ro-follow-links=members[children\].value]

* show parent and its children (full details) +
+
pass:[<pre>http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/PARENT/0?x-ro-follow-links=members[children\].value.href]

* for child +
+
pass:[<pre>http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/CHILD/0`

* child's parent (title) +
+
pass:[<pre>http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/CHILD/0?x-ro-follow-links=members[parent\].value]

* parent, to child, to grandchildren +
+
pass:[<pre>http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/PARENT/0?x-ro-follow-links=members[children\].value.href.members[grandchildren\]]

* child's siblings (up to its parent, down to children) +
+
pass:[<pre>http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/CHILD/0?x-ro-follow-links=members[parent\].value.members[children\].value]

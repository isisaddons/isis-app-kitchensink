# For example, if set to 12, the title
# "Buy milk on 15-Feb-13" will be truncated to "Buy milk ..."

# If set to 0, then only the icon will be shown.

# Encryption key is used to encrypt the rememberMe user/password.  It should be set to a unique and private value.

# intercepted and decrypted, compromising access.
#
# If no value is set then (for safety) a random UUID will be used as the encryption key.  The net effect of this
# default is that 'rememberMe' will work, but only until the webapp is restarted (after which the end-user will
